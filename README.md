# HW 2: k-Nearest Neighbors for CS 349 @ NU
**IMPORTANT: PUT YOUR NETID IN THE FILE** `netid` in the root directory of the assignment. 
This is used to put the autograder output into Canvas. Please don't put someone else's NetID 
here, we will check. The NetID should be placed into that file by itself as the only line, 
with lower case letters and no carriage returns. 

The line that is marked NETID_GOES_HERE should be **REPLACED** with YOUR NetID.

**IF YOU DON'T PUT YOUR NETID INTO THAT FILE PROPERLY YOU WILL NOT RECIEVE CREDIT FOR YOUR WORK!**
